Enlyten Hub for ROBLOX Slap Battles:

Enlyten Hub is a constantly updated, tested, keyless, free script that is meant for ROBLOX Slap Battles by Tencell. Its features include:

COMBAT:

Target Player: [WRITE PLAYER USERNAME OR PART OF IT] - Press enter to activate, will save that user as your target

Legit Slap Aura [SAFEST]: Enables legit Slap Aura, making the invisible slap range aura around you significantly smaller than Slap Aura 1 & 2.
^ Working slap aura that only slaps when the users slaps, and has a smaller aura than the following slap auras. Can look legitimate if used correctly.

Slap Aura 1 [SAFE]: Enables Slap Aura, allows you to hit users within a large, invisible aura around you.
^ Working slap aura that has a slight cooldown to make sure that the anticheat does not kick you for obtaining to many slaps in a short amount of time. Does not change how overpowered it is though.

Slap Aura 2 [NO COOLDOWN, LESS SAFE]: Enables Slap Aura, allows you to hit users within a large, invisible aura around you
^ Working slap aura that has no cooldown to make sure that the anticheat does not kick you for obtaining to many slaps in a short amount of time. Very overpowered.

^ Enable no slap cooldown [X/✔] (<-- Toggle switch)
